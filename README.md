Hi, I'm Ramissa!
🎓 Junior at Union College, studying Computer Science & Math
🔭 Aspiring Software Developer focusing on User Interface & Machine Learning

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and making that data easier to comprehend through UI. Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science and UI. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

🎯 **Featured Project: Machine Learning Final Project (Purchase Intent Prediction)**  
What I Did: Built an end-to-end ML pipeline using the UCI Online Shoppers dataset to predict whether a browsing session ends in a purchase. Performed EDA with visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots), engineered behavioral features (engagement totals + time-based features), addressed class imbalance with over/under-sampling, and compared models for interpretability and performance.  
Tools:Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Google Colab, Matplotlib/Seaborn

🎯 **Featured Project: Peer Code Review Website**
What We Did: We built a Full-Stack web platform where students and instructors can view shared code, highlight specific lines, and leave collaborative comments for feedback and discussion.
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React), and Python (Django REST)

🎯 **Featured Project: Sustainable Building Energy Analytics (KPMG)**  
What We Did: As part of the KPMG / Break Through Tech “Trusted AI” program, I worked on analyzing real building energy data to identify patterns in heating/cooling loads, forecast energy use, and support more sustainable, data-driven decisions for large commercial buildings. I focused on cleaning and engineering features from time-series data and evaluating models for both accuracy and interpretability.  
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Jupyter, SQL

🛠 **Tech Stack:**  
**Languages:** Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
**Web Dev:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub  
**Databases:** SQL, MySQL
